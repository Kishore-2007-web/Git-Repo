     <pre>Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) was the leader of Nazi Germany and one of the most destructive figures in modern history. 
        Born in Austria, he rose to power in Germany after World War I by exploiting economic hardship, nationalism, and public dissatisfaction.
         In 1933, he became Chancellor of Germany and later established a totalitarian dictatorship.
Hitler promoted an extreme ideology based on racism, anti-Semitism, and authoritarian control.
 His policies led to World War II (1939–1945) and the Holocaust, in which about six million Jews and millions of others were systematically murdered.
  Under his rule, Germany pursued aggressive territorial expansion, causing massive destruction across Europe.
As Allied forces closed in on Berlin, Hitler committed suicide in 1945.
 His actions resulted in unprecedented human suffering and loss, and he is remembered as a symbol of tyranny and the dangers of extremist ideology.</pre>
